            Depression
        </p>

        <pre class="story">

             Waking up every day, school, home, wasting my time, sleep and again, every day.
            all days are like each other, the sky is gray, birds don't sing, the sun isn't shining,
            dead city, sad music, disgusting.
            You are tired of this situation, tired of regular days, tired of everything, and need something new,
            but you just lay down in bed, just woke up for toilet or food sometimes, yawn all day, sleepy all day,
            but at night you can't sleep, be awake until twilight, talking with toxic people, cry, what's wrong with me?
            nobody doesn't, even yourself, fails in school tasks, fake smile, tired, even don't try for a change,
            wish to die sooner, cry, more cry, and more, all seasons fall, the moon doesn't shine as past, movies are boring,
            people are boring, books are super boring, start your days by showing your middle finger to the universe,
            aggressive, board. night, longer than ever, more lonely, voice in your head say: nobody loves you,
            nobody cares about you.
             Toxic people made you think you're not valuable, made you be awake until morning, made you hate yourself,
            thinking about suicide all day, cry, fear, "I don't wanna die! I just need change!" yelled inside,
            think and cry, there is no way to survive, a series of impossible solutions, all block, darkness, the voice
            in your head say: die! kill yourself!, fear, the voice: why are you afraid? you say: it will hurt,
            the voice say: more than life? you say I can't! voice say: coward! weak! save yourself! kill yourself!
            chose the highest building, fly to me! fly to freedom! but you just can't.
             Day after day, week after week, month after month, and year after year, all like each other, dark, but one day,
            it's like other days, but no, there's something different, yelling at anyone makes you angry,
            they asked you what's your problem surprisingly, "they are your problem", they say you change,
            you do not like the past! ( cause you don't let them to bully you, you care about yourself )
            the voice said: don't! they are your friends!, friends! you say with a grin,
             Change loading!
            remove toxic people, fuck them all! courage, the voice say: die!, you say: SHUT UP!
             Tired, this time for real, need to sleep, after cleaning your head in the paper after a long time,
            sleeping.
             Wake up at twilight, need toilet, a glimpse at sky, blue, pink and yellow, fascinating!
            the crescent moon, few stars, the sun behind the mountains, raising slowly, hug the first glow of light with a smile,
            warm, calm, taste of happiness after a long while, welcome back a stronger version of me! :)

            Color's personality ( part one )
        </p>

        <pre class="story">

             Have you ever thought if colors were human, what character did they have?
            In my world, black is powerful, like that person who is not liked by many people,
            but they respect it and are afraid too. they talk about it with jealousy,
            Black is self-made, nice with animals and hates people, silent and mysterious,
            a fighter, a coach, a leader, some words color is black in my mind, like success, bold and attacker.
             Blue is for joy, delighted, smiling all the time, dreamer.
            some words are blue like light, fly, breath, air and wind, blue is energetic,
            doing several works at one time, having a cafe with a little garden full of flowers, glad color.
             Emerald, rich one! proud, look at everyone from the top, jealous somehow,
            trying to attract black, hate blue, hate that smile, trying to ignore it but can't,
            sometimes want to be in blue place cause blue has real friends and its center of attention without knowing it,
            but emerald friend are fake and toxic.
             Gray, depressed one, alone, overthink, it doesn't say much, others like gray even emerald!
            but gray can't connect with others, shy.
             Brown, always read the book, it's thin and tall m smells good, love coffee, stays awake at night,
            watch anime and read books, it have a cat.
             Red, aggressive one! change mood every second, angry, glad, anxious, excited,
            no one can't knows what's the next move, red is attractive beside of all colors except emerald,
            emerald doesn't admire it in public but it thinks like others, actually rad looking so good indeed,
            but mentally... kind of different, hard to know it!
             Orange, blue's best friend, hyperactive wacky, but kind, with a 3-year-old inner child!
            love running, can't sit somewhere for 1 minute, only calm when sleep.
